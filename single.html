									<h2>1. Set up Parental Controls on Your Wi-Fi Router and Modem</h2>
									<p>Modern Wi-Fi routers come equipped with security features, enabling you to control internet access within your home network. Brands like Netgear offer parental controls, allowing you to block specific domains and keywords. By making your Wi-Fi router the choke point for internet access, web filters can be applied to all devices on the network.</p>
							
									<p>Enable site restrictions through your home Wi-Fi router. You can set restrictions on your network by creating time limits or by blocking specific websites. You can block websites by adding specific URLs or by uploading lists of websites that you don’t want your children to use (e.g., adult websites, gambling sites, etc.).</p>
									<p>Keep your home Wi-Fi router away from the kids. Children can reset your router’s settings by restarting the device, and they can bypass parental controls by plugging directly into an ethernet connection. Minimize the chances of your kids tampering with the router by keeping it in a secure location — for example, in your bedroom or in the attic.</p>
									<p>Disable the wireless remote administrator feature. This feature permits access to your router's settings from outside your home network. Turning off this function is important to prevent unauthorized access or potential security breaches.</p>

									<h2>2. Schedule Daily Internet Black-Out Periods</h2>
									<p>Encourage a healthy balance between screen time and other activities by setting clear boundaries around device use. With set times for turning off the internet, you can promote offline activities — like reading, outdoor play, and family time.</p>
									<p>Talk about the plan as a family. Help your children understand the need to moderate screen time, especially for healthy sleep habits and family interaction. Together, come up with ideas for other activities to enjoy when gaming and social media are not options.</p>
									<p>Determine the downtime. After chatting about everyone’s needs, decide on the ideal times to restrict internet access. For example, access may be off limits during homework hours, dinnertime, and bedtime.</p>
									<p>Set the black-out periods on your router or parental controls app. Log in to your router's administration settings, and customize the time-based restrictions to switch your internet connection on and off at specified times. You can also use Aura’s Pause The Internet® feature to automatically shut off mobile internet access.</p>

									<h2>3. Scan for and Shut Down Any Nearby Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks</h2>
									<p>If your children have access to unsecured networks — such as a neighbor’s Wi-Fi — they could view adult content or end up on unsafe websites.</p>
									<p>Conduct a Wi-Fi search from your home. Access the Wi-Fi search feature on your cell phone or laptop to check for available networks. Run a search from multiple access points in your home, including your child's bedroom. With each check, you might find hotspots and networks from neighboring properties.</p>
									<p>Check for open networks. Any network that doesn’t require a password poses a risk. If you detect unsecured networks with strong signal strength, they’re probably coming from a house or building nearby.</p>
									<p>Talk to your neighbors. A casual conversation with your neighbors or nearby business owners can help you find the source of unsecured networks. Explain your goal of protecting your children online, and ask the neighbors to put a password on their wireless network.</p>

									<h2>4. Enable Parental Controls on Your Child’s Phone or Tablet</h2>
									<p>The FBI's pursuit of an extortionist targeting teenagers on Instagram underscores the need for robust parental controls on mobile devices. Aura's family safety app, Qustodio, and platform-specific tools like Apple's Screen Time and Google's Family Link offer comprehensive solutions.</p>
									<p>For all mobile devices: Aura’s award-winning family safety app lets you monitor your child’s mobile device, block or restrict access to specific sites and apps, set time limits on games and apps, or completely turn off internet access. </p>
									<p>For iOS devices: Apple's Screen Time settings let you manage app access, game usage, and downloads and set specific downtime periods. You can manage settings on Macs, iPhones, and iPads with a password. Alternatively, the Family Sharing option on your Apple account will be harder for crafty teenagers to circumvent.</p>
									<p>For Android devices: For children under 13, Google's Family Link allows you to track and control your kid’s online activity from your phone, including text messaging and social media.</p>

									<h2>5. Set Up Parental Controls on Your Child’s Gaming Console</h2>
									<p>With children spending significant time on gaming, it's crucial to implement controls on gaming consoles. Set time limits, utilize Safe Gaming tools, and manage chat features to ensure a balanced gaming experience. </p>
									<p>Implement time limits on gaming. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that kids should game for no more than 60 minutes on school days and no more than two hours on non-school days.</p>
									<p>Use Safe Gaming tools. You can set up built-in parental controls to monitor for cyberbullying or predatory behavior.</p>
									<p>Limit or block chat features. It's a good idea to disable the chat function completely for younger children. Encourage teens to use voice chat with speakers rather than headphones. If there is any abusive language or suspicious behavior, you'll hear it.</p>

									<h2>6. Keep Laptops and Smartphones in Shared Spaces</h2>
									<p>You can monitor gaming activities by keeping your children's consoles in the living room or kitchen. While many kids — especially teens — will likely protest, this approach makes it easier to keep tabs on how your children use the internet.</p>
									<p>Create house rules. Make it clear to your children that they can’t use their devices in their bedrooms. As an exception, you could permit laptop use for homework during set hours.</p>
									<p>Set up a workspace in a shared area. You can create an inviting study space with a table, comfortable chairs, charging stations, and multiple outlets. Encourage everyone to do their homework here together.</p>
									<p>Set a device bedtime. By insisting that everybody in the house leaves their devices in a basket in the kitchen, you can combat late-night scrolling and gaming — and promote healthy sleep habits. Alternatively, you can Pause the Internet® at night by using Aura’s family safety app.</p>

									<h2>7. Encourage Responsible Social Media Behavior</h2>
									<p>Over 500 school systems are engaged in a federal lawsuit against social media companies accused of fueling a mental health crisis upon today’s youth. At least one-third of girls aged 11-15 admit they are addicted to platforms like TikTok, Snapchat, and Facebook. Parents must teach kids about responsible social media use — emphasizing how to avoid risks and be kind to others.</p>
									<p>Help your kids develop a healthy relationship with social media:
										<ul>
											<li>Preach digital citizenship. Remind your children that their online actions have real-world consequences. Encourage positive interactions and discourage cyberbullying or negative behavior.</li>
											<li>Set privacy settings. Ensure that your child's social media accounts are set to private, limiting who can see their posts and interact with them online.</li>
											<li>Teach them to think before they post. Remind your children that anything they share online can potentially be seen by anyone. Encourage them to think twice before posting photos, comments, or personal information.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</section>
								<ul>
									<li>Spend time online together to teach your kid appropriate online behaviors. This way you can also familiarize yourself with the tools online your child uses. </li>
									<li>Keep the computer/laptop in a common area in your home. Monitor any time spent on private devices like smartphones or tablets. </li>
									<li>Check your credit card for unfamiliar account charges</li>
									<li>Take your child seriously if they report feeling uncomfrotable online </li>
									<li>Have conversations about safety with your kids, restrict using other softwares as necessary. Example Software: Qustodio </li>
								  </ul>
								<p>Taking an active role in your kids' online activities helps ensure that they benefit from them without being exposed to the potential dangers.</p>
